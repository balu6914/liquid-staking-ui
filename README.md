# Liquid Staking DApp

## Overview

This project implements a **Liquid Staking DApp** on the Ethereum testnet (Polygon Amoy). Users can deposit ETH, which is staked on the network, and they receive liquid staking tokens (ERC-20) representing their share of the staked ETH. Users can redeem their staked ETH by burning the liquid staking tokens.

The DApp provides a simple front-end interface for interacting with the staking contract. It allows users to easily stake, view their balance, and redeem their ETH.

## Features

- **Deposit ETH**: Stake ETH and receive liquid staking tokens.
- **Staking Rewards**: Rewards are calculated and distributed periodically to staking token holders.
- **Redeem ETH**: Redeem staked ETH by burning the liquid staking tokens.

## Tech Stack

- **Solidity**: Smart contract development.
- **Ethers.js**: Blockchain interaction with Ethereum.
- **React.js**: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development and testing environment.
- **Vercel**: For hosting the front-end of the DApp.

## Contract Addresses

- **Staking Contract**: `0xYourStakingContractAddress`
- **Liquid Staking Token Contract**: `0xYourTokenContractAddress`
- **Deployed Frontend**: [https://liquid-staking-ui-vert.vercel.app/](https://liquid-staking-ui-vert.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm** (Node package manager)
- **Hardhat** (Ethereum development framework)
- **Metamask** (Browser wallet)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/liquid-staking-dapp.git
   cd liquid-staking-dapp
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

       ```env
    REACT_APP_STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xEFaFa16cA14408022380Bc1Fc285d982a6674452
    REACT_APP_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x153349067C48c9E2a1935E8E1013572d1b708CFd
    REACT_APP_POLYGON_AMOY_RPC_URL=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/
   ```

   Replace the contract addresses with your deployed contract addresses.

### Running Locally

1. To start the front-end development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will run the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

2. To interact with the smart contracts, make sure your browser is connected to the Polygon Amoy testnet via Metamask.

### Deploying Contracts

1. To deploy the staking and token contracts on the testnet, run:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon_amoy
   ```

   After deployment, update the `.env` file with the new contract addresses.

### Testing Smart Contracts

Unit tests for the smart contracts are written using Hardhat. You can run the tests by executing:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

This will run all the tests and validate the staking, redeeming, and rewards distribution functionalities.

## Usage

### Interacting with the DApp

- **Deposit ETH**: Enter the amount of ETH you wish to deposit and click the "Deposit ETH" button.
- **Redeem ETH**: Enter the amount of liquid staking tokens to redeem and click the "Redeem ETH" button.
- **View Staked Balance**: Your staked balance is displayed in real-time after connecting your wallet.

### Front-End Deployment (Vercel)

The front-end of the DApp is deployed on Vercel at the following URL:

[https://liquid-staking-ui-vert.vercel.app/](https://liquid-staking-ui-vert.vercel.app/)

To deploy the front-end yourself:

1. Push the repository to **GitHub**.
2. Sign in to **Vercel**, create a new project, and link it to your GitHub repository.
3. Configure the environment variables in Vercel's settings, then deploy.

### Key Notes:
- Make sure to replace `0xYourStakingContractAddress` and `0xYourTokenContractAddress` with your actual contract addresses.
- Add the proper GitHub link for your project in the clone instructions.
